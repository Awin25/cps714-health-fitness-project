# Frontend setup instructions

To set up the frontend project, navigate to this folder (.../frontend) in cmd or terminal and run `npm install`

To run the frontend, run `npm run serve` and go to http://localhost:8080/
This automatically compiles and re-runs if you make any changes to the code.

<!--
### Compiles and minifies for production
